# Two columns

Below is a Div containing three child Divs side by side. The Div
in the middle is empty, just to add more space between the left
and right Divs.

:::::: {.cols data-latex=""}

::: {.col data-latex="{0.55\textwidth}"}
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .2, .1))
plot(cars, pch = 19)
```
:::

::: {.col data-latex="{0.05\textwidth}"}
\ 
<!-- an empty Div (with a white space), serving as
a column separator -->
:::

::: {.col data-latex="{0.4\textwidth}"}
The figure on the left-hand side shows the `cars` data.
